**Space Traveller**

I'm currently developing an exciting React-based game where players navigate a spacecraft, dodging or shooting meteors to survive. Key features include:

- **Limited Bullet Stock:** Manage your ammo carefully.
- **Dynamic Meteor Appearances:** Meteors have random, natural looks.
- **Scoring System:** Earn points for each meteor hit.
- **Game Countdown:** A timer counts down to start each level.
- **Info and Pause:** Access game information and pause the action.
- **Sound Control:** Toggle voice effects on or off.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Experience changing backgrounds as you play.
- **Cool Animations:** Enjoy engaging visual effects.
- **Timed Levels:** Each level has a set time limit.
- **Multiple Levels:** Progress through various stages with increasing difficulty.

Join the adventure and test your skills in this interstellar challenge!
